hello yes so actually the embed chain version was not working and it was causing an error so what I did was, I said it to a very very old version to see what the latest version crew AI is using so the latest version of embed chain that was being used in crew AI was 0.1.113 yeah so what I did was installed that version uninstalled the old one and now it is working perfectly

I am using the crew AI version from two July that was available on the PPI repository and also I am using. I'm using the embed chain version 0.1.113
