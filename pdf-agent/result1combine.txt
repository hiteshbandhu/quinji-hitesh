```python
import os
from PyPDF2 import PdfMerger

def combine_pdfs(directory, output_filename):
    # Create a PdfMerger object
    merger = PdfMerger()
    
    # Iterate through all the files in the directory
    for filename in os.listdir(directory):
        # Check if the file is a PDF
        if filename.endswith(".pdf"):
            filepath = os.path.join(directory, filename)
            # Append the PDF to the merger
            merger.append(filepath)
    
    # Write the combined PDF to the output file
    with open(output_filename, 'wb') as output_file:
        merger.write(output_file)

    # Close the PdfMerger object
    merger.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Define the directory containing the PDFs and the output filename
    directory = "path/to/your/pdf_directory"
    output_filename = "combined_output.pdf"
    
    # Combine all PDFs in the directory
    combine_pdfs(directory, output_filename)
```

This script uses the `PyPDF2` library to combine all PDF files in a specified directory into a single output PDF file. Make sure to replace `"path/to/your/pdf_directory"` with the actual path to your directory containing the PDF files. The combined PDF will be saved as `combined_output.pdf` in the current working directory. 

To install the necessary library, you can use the following pip command:
```sh
pip install PyPDF2
```

This code is ready to be executed in a Python environment.
