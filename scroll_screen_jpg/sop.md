### Made Using Claude and here is the prompt

```txt
Make me a chrome extension to do the following in javascript : 

    use selenium to take screenshot of the page
    scroll one VH and take another screenshot
    repeat until the whole screen is screenshoted vertically
    then, combine those files vertically
    save them in the downloads folder

-- use selenium and you can also use libraries as you want
-- i should see the file being downloaded in the download pane
-- make sure to handle errors
```
